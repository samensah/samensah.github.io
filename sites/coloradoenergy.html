If we do not have a Meter reading on the date of the rate change, we will make an estimate of the reading on the date the price change takes effect and calculate your energy charges based on that estimate.<br/>9.5. If you are on one of our Fixed Tariffs, we will provide you with appropriate alternative tariff options prior to the end of the Fixed Tariff. You may choose to move onto any of these alternatives when the Fixed Tariff ends. If you do not make an active selection of an alternative tariff, you will move onto our Variable Tariff.<br/>9.6.

Your Metering Equipment</strong></h3><p>10.1. If we are supplying you with a Smart Meter, we will arrange installation on a date and time that is convenient to you.

Unless you have a functioning Smart Meter that can provide us with your Meter readings remotely, you must give us a Meter reading when requested by us. This will help us make sure your Charges are as accurate as possible. <br/>10.6. If no Meter reading is provided to us, we will produce a reasonable estimate of usage at the Address. You agree to accept the estimate amount for the purpose of calculating your Charges, or to give us an actual Meter reading. If you give us an actual reading after the statement has been produced we can send you a new statement at your request, but in any case we will use that reading when we work out your next statement.<br/>10.7. When we receive a Meter reading from you (or our authorised Meter reader) which shows that any previous estimated reading may have been significantly over or underestimated, we may cancel and replace the relevant statements. If there has been any change to the Unit Rates during that time, we will use the relevant price at the time to work out the new statement. This will be based on our revised estimate of consumption through the period.<br/>10.8. If, in our reasonable opinion, the Meter reading you provide is not accurate, we will not be required to base our calculation on the reading provided, but will contact you to either get a new Meter reading or send our approved meter reader to obtain a Meter reading instead.<br/>10.9.

If you are on our Variable Tariff, you may end this Contract at any time after your Supply Start Date without being liable to pay any additional fee. If you are on one of our Fixed Tariffs, you may be charged an Exit Fee if you end this Contract more than 49 days before the end of your Fixed Tariff. If you wish to end the Contract because you are moving home, then you should follow the process at section 12 below. This Contract will automatically end where our supply of Energy to the Address has been disconnected for any reason, including because you have transferred to another supplier or Ofgem has given a ‘Last Resort Supply Direction’ to another supplier in respect of the Energy to your Address.<br/>11.2. You will remain liable to pay all Charges incurred up to the Contract End Date, even after the Contract has ended.<br/>11.3. If you transfer to another supplier we may pass them any relevant details we deem (acting reasonably) that they may need to help with this transfer. If you object to us giving the other supplier any details that are required to enable the transfer to proceed, please notify us and we will stop the transfer.<br/>11.4. We may end this Contract:<br/>11.4.1. if you are in breach of any terms of the Contract, including if you fail to pay the Charges when they become due, or if you refuse to pay us a Deposit as requested; or<br/>11.4.2. if we no longer have the relevant licence(s) to supply your Energy; or<br/>11.4.3. if we are required to do so by law or by our regulator, Ofgem; and<br/>The provisions in this clause 11.4 do not affect the statutory rights you have against us.<br/>11.5. When your Contract ends, we will calculate the Standing Charges as a pro-rata amount for the number of days you were with Colorado Energy during your final month (up to and including the Contract End Date) and adjust the Charges you owe us accordingly.<br/>11.6. You agree:<br/>11.6.1. to pay all Charges incurred up to the date we cease to provide Energy to your Address (the Contract End Date) on your Account within 30 days of the date we notify you of the amount owed;<br/>11.6.2. that if you owe us money we have the right to object to your transferring supply to another Energy supplier until you have paid to us the balance outstanding on your Account in full.<br/></p></div><div class="w-container"><h3><strong>12. Moving home</strong></h3><p>12.1. You should give us between two and zero days' notice of your planned moving date if you are moving home.

If you give us notice in accordance with section <br/>12.1 above, we will aim to end your Contract at the Address on the day you have notified us that you will move out. If there are Charges incurred during the period between the date you have notified us that you will move out and the date you cease to own or be liable to pay utility bills at the Address, then the Contract End Date will be the later of the two dates.<br/>12.3. If you wish to have Colorado Energy supply Energy at your new address then you can remain a Customer but your old energy account will be closed and you will need to switch to Colorado Energy  - and a new energy account will be opened - when you move into your new address.<br/>12.4. If you do not notify us of your moving date in accordance with section 12.1 above then:<br/>12.4.1. the Contract End Date will not be until 2 days after we have received notice that you are moving house, or when we are notified someone else has moved into the Address, whichever<br/>occurs first, and you will be responsible for continuing to pay the Charges until that date;<br/>12.4.2. if you have a smart meter, we will be unable to prevent the new occupier of the Address from viewing your energy data via the In Home Display.; and<br/>12.4.3. we will charge Exit Fees to your account when you move home if you are liable for them.

If we supply you with gas, we and the Gas Transporter which operates the network through which the gas is supplied to the Address may restrict or stop the use of your gas if required by law or in an emergency. You must then follow our instructions. If you receive such a request you may be entitled to a compensatory payment that will be payable as soon as reasonably practicable after we receive it from the party liable to make that payment.<br/>13.6.

Your personal information</h3><p>15.1. We agree that we will only use any Personal Data that you provide to us in accordance with our Privacy Policy (found in the Legal section of the account) which forms part of the Contract.<br/>15.2. We may run checks on you (and anyone else also responsible for payment of the Charges) through credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, initially and periodically to help us assess your ability to pay our bills, check your identity, prevent and detect fraud and recover debt. When we run any check, the credit reference agency will record the fact that a check was made, whether or not you become a customer of Colorado Energy..<br/>15.3. If you have an Account with us, we will routinely share information about your payment record with credit reference agencies for the purpose of credit checking. If we consider that your Account is in default (i.e. you have not paid us and are in breach of your agreement with us) we will notify you and if you do not pay us we will report the unpaid debt to credit reference agencies who will record that default on your credit file. They might give that information to other organisations and fraud prevention agencies to carry out similar checks, find out where you are and collect any money you owe.<br/>15.4. If we suspect that someone has committed fraud or stolen Energy by tampering with the meter or diverting the Energy supply, we’ll make a note of it on your Account. We can then share that information with Ofgem, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. The information might also go to law enforcement agencies such as the police and HM Revenue and Customs.<br/>15.5. We can use this information to make decisions about you, including how likely we think it is that you’ll be able to pay for your supply and other Energy services. By doing this we might record Sensitive<br/>Personal Data about you, such as criminal offences you’ve been accused of.<br/>15.6. If you have tampered with the supply to the Address or stolen Energy, or if we suspect you have, then we can take that into account when we decide what products or services to offer you, and what terms we offer you.<br/>15.7. For further information on the Personal Data processing activities detailed in sections 15.1 to 15.6 above, please refer to our Privacy Policy (found on our website).<br/></p></div><div class="w-container"><h3>16.

If the Gas Transporter or the Network Operator causes you any loss or damage, we will only be legally responsible to you for the amount we are entitled to recover from the party at fault.<br/></p></div><div class="w-container"><h3>18.

None of this affects your rights under the Contract. If you are unhappy with any transfer or subcontracting of rights under this Contract then you are entitled to end the Contract in accordance with section 11.<br/>18.2.
